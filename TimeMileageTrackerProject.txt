Requirements analysis:
-create an effective way to track time and mileage for a task
in a milestone associated with the project for a specific client.

Existing tools
-github
-toggl
-google docs (optional)


Design
- web application framework: Struts 2
- web server/ servlet container: apache Tomcat
- java server pages
- H2 database engine (uncertain: need to research)
- bottom-up design

Ideas
- can clients log in and see times for contractor
- different accounts for client vs contractor
-as a contractor, with several clients, store different clients' time 
    and mileage seperately
- relational databases to relate clients to servers, then they can 
        
    user -has projects
         -has type (contractor, client)
         -has github username 

    project
        -has a client
        -has github URL
                
    client
        -has projects 
        -has users

    milestone (optional in github)
        -has github URL

    issue (optionally has milestone)
        - has rate items 
        -has github URL

    (work -things that require time)
    milestones -> issues -> time  -> mileage
    issues


    have rate item with type, rate and amount.

    time -associated with a projects
    -has a rate and amount

    mileage 
    -rate of cost per mile
    -amount of miles


-associate github account with user account


Other Notes
-clock in/out
-mileage
-"fix time" (insert historical time while currently counting time)
-duration, start time, and end time
